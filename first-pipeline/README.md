My first pipeline to setting docker container as build agent for jenkins

#Jenkinsfile2 is about multi-stage-multi-agent 
#Setting up a multi stage jenkins pipeline where each stage is run on a unique agent. 
#A useful approach when you have multi language application or application that has conflicting dependencies.
